1. difference bw error and exception?

error - It is irrecoverable ex - StackoverflowError ,IOError 

Exception - It is recoverable ex  - NullPointerException, ArrayOutofBound

2. Java Exception

try - The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. It means we can't use try block alone. 

catch - The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone

finally - The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.

throw - The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.

throws - The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method.


Examples: 

//try-catch block

public class JavaExceptionExample{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   try{  
      //code that may raise exception  
      int data=100/0;  
   }catch(ArithmeticException e){System.out.println(e);}  
   //rest code of the program   
   System.out.println("rest of the code...");  
  }  
}
