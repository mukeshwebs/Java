//there are two types of polymorphism

1. Run time poly -> acheieved by method overiding
2. Compile time poly -> acheived by method overloading

//method overloading ->multiple methods can have the same name with different parameter

static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

//method overiding ->same method name and same parameter


//Polymorphism real life example

Suppose if you are in class room that time you behave like a student, 
when you are in market at that time you behave like a customer,
when you at your home at that time you behave like a son or daughter,
Here one person present in different-different behaviors.
